# Text-and-Audio-Description-Generator-for-Image
This project is a smart web-based application that generates natural language descriptions for uploaded images and provides audio narration of those descriptions. Users can easily upload an image through a user-friendly frontend, and the system automatically analyzes the image, generates a relevant caption, and converts the caption into speech.

The backend uses a trained deep learning model for image captioning, capable of interpreting the visual content and producing human-like descriptions. Once the caption is created, a text-to-speech engine transforms the text into spoken audio, providing an accessible experience for a wider range of users.
